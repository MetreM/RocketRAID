At the moment I try to get the "<drivername>-kernel-4-x" patch working with all drivers. 

At the moment the following drivers are working with kernel >=4.7:
- rr232x
- rr2340

This drivers will not work with kernel >=4.7 (I don't get the patch to work with this drivers):
- rr62x
- rr2644

The other drivers I will uppdate soon.
